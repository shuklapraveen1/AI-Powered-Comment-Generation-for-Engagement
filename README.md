# 🤖 AI-Powered LinkedIn Comment Generator

This project is a lightweight, beginner-friendly Python tool that uses **OpenAI GPT-4** and **TextBlob** to generate thoughtful, high-quality LinkedIn comments for healthcare AI executives (or any other professionals).

## 🚀 Features

- Analyzes a LinkedIn post for tone, key points, and engagement value.
- Generates a 2–3 sentence comment in a chosen style (e.g., professional).
- Automatically evaluates the comment's sentiment and length.
- Logs all interactions (post, comment, status) to a file.
- Keeps everything under 25 lines of Python code!

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API Key
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install openai textblob
  ```

## 🔐 Set Up OpenAI API Key

Before using the script, set your OpenAI key as an environment variable:

**Linux/macOS**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Windows (CMD)**
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Paste a LinkedIn post when prompted.
2. The script:
   - Analyzes the post with GPT-4.
   - Generates a thoughtful comment.
   - Checks if the comment is suitable using sentiment and length.
   - Prints everything and saves it to `linkedin_engagement.txt`.

## 💬 Example Output

```
